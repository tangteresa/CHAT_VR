Program: Unreal Engine

Purpose: Virtual Reality environment (tested with Oculus Rift) developed for CS 1620 final project at Cornell University. Project requirements included realistic lighting, interesting and well-decorated environment, an animated object of choice (our group used a crochet snail), and aesthetically pleasing architecture. 

Storyline: You are a traveler exploring snowy mountains. You stumble across a marble bridge that leads to a mysterious temple with four mini temples representing spring, summer, fall, and winter, all enclosed by a rotating cage. Cross the bridge and stand underneath the lever to stop the rotating cage, then enter the temple to explore the environment. Once you reach winter, look up and admire the aurora borealis lights and night sky! 

Notable features: 
Rotating cage 

Player can stop and start the cage by standing near the giant gold lever (uses trigger box) 

Animated snail 

Climbing to other temples by jumping onto small platforms 

Animated falling leaves 

Personal role: I served as an "Unreal Engine developer," which involved creating the Unreal environment and landscape, populating it with assets and architectural models, adding animations and user interactions in virtual reality mode, as well as defining the areas that the player may navigate and troubleshooting navigation issues. 

The entire project is too large to upload, so if you are interested in the zipped project, please contact me!
